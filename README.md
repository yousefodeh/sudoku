# sudoku

A standard Sudoku contains 81 cells, in a 9Ã—9 grid, and has 9 boxes, 
each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows,
and the first, middle, or last 3 columns.

Each cell may contain a number from one to nine,
and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box. 

A Sudoku starts with some cells containing numbers (clues),
and the goal is to solve the remaining cells.
